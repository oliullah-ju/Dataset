# Sexual Harassment Dataset
Sexual Harassment Touch Classification Dataset

The sexual harassment dataset, which consists of 1048 instances, was collected from 50 students of BUBT (Bangladesh University of Business and Technology). The dataset includes six fields: force 1(gm), force 2(gm), force 3(gm), force 4(gm), force 5(gm), force 6(gm), force 7(gm), force 8(gm),force 9(gm), time(sec), and force type, where the force fields represent force values of touches in the sensitive parts of the human body and the force type field indicates whether it was a harassment touch or an unwanted touch.

The data collection process involved interacting with the 50 student participants from BUBT. Detailed explanations of the study's purpose and guidelines were provided to ensure the voluntary participation of the students. They were asked to record instances of sexual harassment they experienced, specifying the forces involved, the time of occurrence, and the type of force applied. The participants were assured of the confidentiality and anonymity of their responses. The collected dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and suitability for training and testing machine learning models.
